# Development of a deployable Network intrusion Detection system utilising machine learning techniques

This project focuses on building an IDS that incorporates machine learning algorithms for a hospital LAN system.

# Project overview:
- Designed and simulated a simple hospital network topology using GNS3 software.
- Found and prepared a large dataset with a similar nature to our virtual hospital network,used CRISP-DM framework to prepare the data for the machine learning algorithms.
- built and trained 7 models.
- optimised models using techniques such as gridsearch cv
- recorded performance of models using accuracy,precision,recall,f1 score,AUC and confusion matrixs
- combining 4 main components to create the IDS which consisted off a KDD'99 feature extractor,our machine learning models,classifier scripts and a bash script.
- used a Test bash script in order to build a testing framework to observe the simulation performance
- recorded the models performance in the simulation
